Space Debris Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning


Overview:
This project focuses on identifying, categorizing, and assessing the risk of space debris using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. With the increasing number of objects in Earthâ€™s orbit, analyzing space debris is critical to preventing satellite damage and ensuring long-term orbital sustainability.

Objectives:
Cluster space debris based on key physical and orbital characteristics.

Evaluate the quality of clustering using Silhouette metrics.

Predict the risk level posed by debris using classification algorithms.

Provide actionable insights for satellite operators and space agencies.

Key Features:
K-Means Clustering: Used to group debris based on features like velocity, altitude, inclination, and size.

Silhouette Analysis: Evaluates the consistency and separation of clusters to ensure meaningful segmentation.

Random Forest Classifier: Predicts the potential collision risk level based on known labeled datasets and clustering results.

Feature Engineering: Includes normalization, dimensionality reduction (if needed), and encoding orbital dynamics into machine-readable formats.

Visualization: Clusters and risk levels are visualized using 2D and 3D plots for interpretability.

Technologies Used:
-> Python for data analysis and modeling

-> Scikit-learn for ML algorithms (KMeans, RandomForest, Silhouette Score)

-> Pandas / NumPy for data preprocessing

-> Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

-> Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

Results:
-> Achieved high-quality clustering with average Silhouette scores above threshold, indicating strong group coherence.

-> Random Forest classifier yielded high accuracy in risk prediction, demonstrating potential for use in real-world debris tracking systems.

Applications:
Satellite collision avoidance

Orbital traffic management

Policy development for debris mitigation
